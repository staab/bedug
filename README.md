# About

Bedug is a game I wrote to lay the foundation for my three-year-old to begin programming. The idea was to introduce the concept of a procedure, a series of steps that are defined to make something happen. Loops, variables, conditionals, and all the other features that might be considered "beginner level" are deliberately excluded.

This project is inspired by [Kibo](http://kinderlabrobotics.com/kibo/), a robot that learns by scanning a row of command blocks. I think the concept is great, and a much better implementation than bedug, but it's too expensive for most people (me included) to buy for private use.

Other languages and environments are either too full-featured (Sketch), or are text-based (see [The Programming Languages Zoo](http://plzoo.andrej.com/index.html). I wanted my kid to get his hands dirty, even though he can't even use a mouse yet, much less type.
